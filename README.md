# PySceneDetect Wrapper 

## Description
This CLAMS app wraps [PySceneDetect](https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and performs shot boundary detection on input videos.

A shot boundary is a place where one camera shot ends and another begins. The app detects shot boundaries and outputs a list of timestamps where the shot boundaries occur.
